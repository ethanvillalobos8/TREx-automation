# TREx-automation
**Version 1.0**

A Python automation program that web scrapes the Texas Education Agency's website for specific data and writes said data
into a .csv file. Previously, the data had to have been manually recorded into an excel sheet which took around an hour
to complete. With this program, it cuts the time down to around 1 minute and 15 seconds to gather over 50 campuses worth
of data.

**Version 1.1**

Includes campuses by region in order to easily sort or group elements in excel.

v1.0 run-time: 1:16.37

v1.1 run-time: NA
